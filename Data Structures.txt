Data Structure: The way of organising Data

Linear Data Structures: The data is stored sequeuntialy or sequential connection between data.
EX: arrays,Linked List, stack and queue

Stack is a linear Data Structure that follow LIFO

Queue is a Linear Data Structure that follow FIFO

Linked List:  Series of nodes connected by links or reference

Types of LinkedList: Singly LinkedList, Doubly LinkedList, Circular Linked List, Doubly Circular LinkedList

Arrays Vs Linked List
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Data in arrays are stored in continuous memory locations, Data in Linked Lists are not stored in continuous memory
2) size of the array is fixed but not in Lists
3) crud operation time complexity are different

Asysmptotic analysis
-----------------------
The mathematical analysis of algorithm using math bounds

Binary Trees
---------------------------------------

Applications: indexing,decision trees
