OOP refers to the object oriented programming.
It is a programming paradigm where basic organisation of code is as objects
objects have attributes and method


Imperative Programming paradigm
-- focuses of how to do a task

Declarative Programming paradigm

Features of OOP (also called 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming)
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Abstraction

Class: Blueprint/template for an object(data) 

Object: Instance of a Class

Encapsulation: Binding/clubbing Data and methods into together by hiding is called Encapsulation
(hiding implementation or unwanted information)

Polymorphism: Behaving differently in different conditions/ways.

Compile Time Polymorphism: polymorphism that happens at compile time
Also called as static binding.
occurs during method overloading


Runtime polymorphism: Polymorphism that happens at run time
Also called as Dynamic binding.
Occurs duing method overloading

Arguments and functions name are part of method signature
if the signature is same it is called method overriding else it is called method overloading
* method overloading is happens in the same class
* method overriding is heppens between child and parent class
