Js arrow function vs Normal functions

1) arrow function dont have this binding
-> this in a function points to the object which invokes it.
->this is a function points to an class object if the function is inside an object
-> by default the this points to global window object
2)Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors
3)Arrow function cannot be declared they are functional expressions
4)In js function declarations are hoisted but not functional expressions



Node js event loop
---------------------------
Libuv a library in nodejs manages the event loop. event loop is the way how nodejs manages asynchronous programming.
This event loop has micro task queues and macro task queues(timer and io  queues)

preferce of aynchronous execution
1) non aync code
2) micro tasks (promisess)
3) timer queue
4) io queue


var vs let
--------------------------
variable declared with var have global scope and hoisted.
variable declared with let have block scope and are not hoisted.

* self invoking functions in js
-----------------------------------
function fun(){
code
}();


Currying in js
-----------------------
Technique to transform a function of n arguments to n functions of one or fewer arguments

example:-
functionc add(a){
	return function(b){
return a+b;
}
}
add(2)(3)


Scope and Scope Chain in js
-------------------------------------
Scope is accessibility of variable at various parts of one's code.
1) Global scope
2) Block scope
3) Local or Function scope

Closures 
-----------------------------
Ability of a function remember the variable and functions that are declared in outer scope.


*** Object prototyping in js
-------------------------------------------
All js object inherit properties from a prototype.

DOM
-----------------------------------
Document Object Model is a Programming Interface for Html and XML documents


Origin and features of js
----------------------
Was developed by Brendon Eich in 1995 motivation to make web page interactive and dynamic at netscpape communications
** mocha was the initial name
loosely typed
dynamically typed
support oop,functional(functions are first class objects) and procedural
supports closures (python also have closures)
